## General Info

This application is a CLI app. This app is intended for the working professional who wants to view, update, or add to their existing staff/departments. Using Node CLI, and being asked a series of questions via inquirer, the user will be able to navigate what action they would like to perform.

## Instructions

The user must npm install inquirer and mysql. They should take the tables and seeds from the jobs.sql file and put them into WorkBench and then run that code. From there they will answer whatever question they want to, and have the option to end their search after each question.
